# Analyzing Customer Spending Habits with Power BI
This project analyzes customer spending habits using a dataset that includes information about the date, customer age and gender, country and state, product category and sub-category, and revenue generated from the sale. Using Power BI, various visualizations were created to better understand the data, including a scatter plot to show the relationship between unit cost and unit price, a bar chart to show the total revenue by product category, and a stacked column chart to show the sales by customer age group and gender.

# Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have Power BI installed on your computer.

# Usage

Click on the visualizations to interact with them and gain insights into the data.

Use the filters to explore the data by different categories, such as country, product sub-category, or customer age group.

Make changes to the visualizations or create new ones to further analyze the data.
